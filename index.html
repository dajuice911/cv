          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>I have always wanted to code but thought it was much too difficult. Dabbling with C++ assurred me that coding would be an up-hill struggle. It wasn't until I took Python in a Summer course that success in coding could be a possibilty.</p>

          <h3>Troube-Shooting</h3>
          <p>My trouble-shooting skills were developed when I disassembled the original Xbox in order to install a modchip which would enable it to run unsigned code. Not knowing too much of the Internet at that time, I had to slowly find out why and how things worked.</p>
